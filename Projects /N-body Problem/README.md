# Introduction:
The N‑body problem is a classic challenge in physics and astronomy involving the prediction of motion for 
𝑁 interacting bodies under mutual forces. In this project, we model particle interactions using Newton’s law of gravitation. Although electromagnetic forces typically dominate at small scales, we focus on a gravity‑driven system to highlight how astrophysical N‑body techniques can be applied in simplified scenarios. This simulation demonstrates how gravitational interactions evolve over time and serves as a platform for exploring parallel computation using CUDA.
